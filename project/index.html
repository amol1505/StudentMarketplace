      <h4>RISKS THAT AFFECT CONFIDENTIALITY</h4>
      <p>People’s information can only be obtained by authorised users. They can be stolen because the system is tricked into granting access to an ‘authorised’ user.<br>
Protecting personal data in computer systems is as important as the real world. 
This can occur when an unauthorised individual/program gains access to a data item or one that is hidden from that individual’s authorisation privileges, an approximation of a data value is calculated by an unauthorised entity and infiltrators learning of existing new data being developed.</p>
<h4>RISKS THAT AFFECT INTEGRITY</h4>
<p>Integrity is when data has the correct information. It must be accurate and complete.</p>
<ul>
    <li>An organisation without authorisation in a database system can allow anyone to enter data that may not be factual. Only allowing certifiable employees to modify the data, who know what they are adding, can ensure reliability of the new data.</li>
    <li>Errors can occur in processing data that can result in incomplete data, where parts of the information are lost due to processor scheduling. This could happen because the program has bugs in the code that do not consider the entirety of the data.</li>
    <li>The interface may display partial data to the user because the application did not extract all the relevant information to show. This can lead to the outside world responding to differently to if the human(s) viewed the complete data held by the machine.</li>
    <li>Change of management within the organisation that holds/manages the data can allow the risk of human error where the previous administrator of the data could forget to inform the new admin about all/some of managing the application systems.</li>
</ul>
<h4>RISKS THAT AFFECT AVAILABILITY</h4>
<p>This ensures that only authorised users have access to the information and resources held by an organisation.</p>
<ul>
    <li>External threats (such as earthquakes and other natural disasters) or internal threats (e.g. fire) can completely damage the data altogether making it lost and readable to no one.</li>
    <li>Criminals physically breaking into a server room of the organisation and stealing the hardware with the data stored inside.</li>
    <li>A lack of hardware, software or staff leads to a lack of management and authentication functions that control who can look at what data.</li>
    <li>Hardware and software failures as well as bugs due to lack of maintenance prevents the organisation’s ability to present/hide information.</li>
    <li>IT planning failure to recover files due to not backing up the systems.</li>
    <li>Cyber attacks that result in system and network overloads. This stops online access for the authorised user(s) to communicate with the computer services.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>RISK MITIGATION</h4>
    <p>It is a set of policies and procedures to ensure the reduction of potential problems that are exposed in a business, such as any form of attack on the computer systems.<br>
    Following are some tips on how to mitigate these risks:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Keep it simple - there is no need to address every risk you encounter</li>
        <li>Prioritise - violence prevention usually is the most important aspect every business should prioritise. This is achieved through environmental design such as unobstructed windows, digital video, and alarms.</li>
        <li>You can reduce, avoid, accept, or transfer risks - each of these strategies will have different costs. strategy development is the process of deciding which risks you should address and in what manner and this should be done accordingly to what you have decided to prioritise and in what way the risk can harm your business's computer systems.</li>
        <li>Follow standards - the ISO 27000 Directory is a series of standards reserved for computer systems security matters, as well as others. Following these standards will help securing both the physical and logical components of the business's systems.</li>
        <li>Layered protection - this is also known as defense-in-depth. The asset is put in the centre surrounded by layers of protection that together protect the asset. These are tools such as VPNs, AntiVirus and others.</li>
        </ul>
 
 
 
 
          <h4>WHAT IS A NETWORK?</h4>
           <p>A network is a collection of computers, servers, mainframes, network devices or other devices which are connected together which ultimately enables the sharing of data. An example of this is the Internet, which connects millions of people all over the world. (Computer Hope, 2018) </p>
           <h4>WHAT ARE THE COMPONENTS OF A NETWORK?</h4>
           <p>The crucial components of a network are usually.</p>
          <ul>
	<li>NIC</li>
               <li>Switch</li>
               <li>Cables (only for physical networks)</li>
               <li>Hub</li>
 	<li>Router</li>
	 <li>Modem</li>
         </ul>
        <h6>NIC</h6>
        <ul>
       	 <li>NIC stands for network interface card.</li>
       	<li>NIC is a hardware component used to connect a computer with another computer onto a network.</li>
      	<li>It can support a transfer rate of 10,100 to 1000 Mb/s.</li>
<li>The MAC address or physical address is encoded on the network card chip which is usually assigned to identify a network card uniquely. It is stored in the PROM (Programmable read-only memory).</li>
<li>There are two types which are wired and wireless. The wired NIC is present in the motherboard to transfer data, meanwhile the wireless NIC is present within the antenna to obtain data </li>
          </ul>
       <h6>Switch</h6>
        <ul>
       	 <li>A switch is a hardware device that connects multiple devices on a computer network.</li>
       	<li>The switch contains the updated table that decides where the data is transmitted or not. It also  delivers the message to the correct destination based on the physical address present in the incoming message..</li>
      	<li>A switch does not broadcast the message to the entire network like the Hub</li>
<li>The  switch provides a direct connection between the source and destination which increases the speed of the network.</li>
          </ul>
        <h6>Cables</h6>
        <ul>
       	 <li>Cable is a transmission media used for transmitting a signal.</li>
       	<li>Three types are twisted pair, coaxial and fibre-optic.</li>
          </ul>
 
       <h6>Hub</h6>
        <ul>
       	 <li>A hardware device that divides the network connection among multiple devices.</li>
       	<li>Broadcasts the request for some information regarding a network from the computer to the entire network.</li>
      	<li>Consumes a lot of bandwidth and has become obsolete thanks to the use of routers and switches.</li>
          </ul>
 
     <h6>Router</h6>
        <ul>
       	 <li>A hardware device that is used to connect a LAN with an internet connection</li>
       	<li>Also used to receive, analyze and forward the incoming packets to another network</li>
      	<li>A router forwards the packet based off the routing table information and then determines the best transmission path for it.</li>
          </ul>
   <h6>Modem</h6>
        <ul>
       	 <li> A hardware device which allows the connection of a computer  to the internet over a telephone line</li>
       	<li>Stands for modulator/demodulator and is located on the PCI slot of the motherboard where it can convert digital data into analog signals.  </li>
      	<li> Can be classified in the following categories: standard PC modem or Dial-up modem, cellular modem, cable modem, cables and connectors. (Javatpoint, n.d.)</li>
          </ul>
 
<h4>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LAN, MAN AND WAN</h4>
<p>A Local Area Network (LAN) is a network restricted to a small area. Typical geographical areas consist of writing labs, schools, or buildings. Computers and servers may be connected by cables or wirelessly on a LAN. Wireless access to a wired network is made possible by wireless access points (WAPs). These WAP devices link computers and networks.</p>
<p>Wide Area Networks (WANs) connect networks in larger geographic areas, such as Brighton,  the United Kingdom, or the world. It uses multiplexers, bridges, and routers to connect local and metropolitan networks to global communications networks (Winkelman, n.d.). There are two types of WAN: Switched WAN and Point-to-Point WAN.. Similar to a MAN, the fault tolerance of a WAN is less and there is more congestion in the network. A communication medium that can be used for WAN are either PSTN or Satellite Link. However, there are more errors and noise due to the long distance transmission as well as the data transfer rate being slow.</p>
<p>MAN or Metropolitan area Network are able to cover larger areas than that of a LAN and smaller areas compared to what a WAN can offer. It is able to connect two or more computers that are far apart regardless of their locations within a certain area. There is a possibility of it being able to act as an internet service provider due to the area that it can cover. Alongside this, it is designed for customers who require high-speed connectivity. The data transfer rate is moderate and examples of devices which use these transmissions are the modem and cables/wire. (Goyal, n.d.)</p>\
 
<h4>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PHYSICAL AND WIRELESS NETWORKS</h4>
<p>A physical network refers to any physical medium consisting of cables. The cables can be copper wire, twisted pair or fiber optic. They are used to carry different forms of electrical signals from one end to the other. In addition,  T1 lines, and cable modems can be used to undertake internet connection which can be shared by multiple devices. Examples include a LAN which is connected with the aid of ethernet cables.</p>
<p>"Wireless" is the term refers to medium made of electromagnetic waves (i.e. EM Waves) or infrared waves without the use of wires. Typical wireless devices involved include cellular mobile or laptops with WLAN cards where they have antennas or sensors. Examples of wireless networks are the fiber optic communication link and broadband ADSL. (RF Wireless World, n.d.)</p>
 
           <h4>NETWORK RISKS</h4>
           <p>There are many risks that can occur with the use of networks. The following are categories of potential risks that can occur.</p>
           <ul>
               <li>loss of confidentiality – this is when data has been disclosed to an unauthorised individual.</li>
               <li>loss of integrity – this is when an attacker uses resources to obtain , delete or alter sensitive data and information.</li>
               <li>loss of availability– this is the approach to be unable to access data from certain devices and sources.</li>
           </ul>
           <p>Risks can also affect a business's mission, functions, image and reputation as well as an individual's assets.</p>
 
 
           <h4>RISKS THAT AFFECT CONFIDENTIALITY</h4>
           <p>Some risks that could occur can affect the loss of confidentiality which is where private / confidential information is shared or loss. An example of this can be eavesdropping where an attacker is able to obtain private data or information passively. Another example can be trojan horses which are malicious bits of attacking code or software that can trick users into running it willingly, by hiding behind a legitimate program. This ultimately allows attackers to gain access of a private network.</p>
           <h4>RISKS THAT AFFECT INTEGRITY</h4>
           <p>This aspect of networks consists of data being altered or deleted by an attacker who has malicious intentions. This can be done by an attacker who has malicious intent, or this can naturally occur overtime from overuse / weariness. A common example is data ransoming where the attacker has access to personal data and threatens to leak it unless a ransom is paid.</p>
 </p>
           <h4>RISKS THAT AFFECT AVAILABILITY</h4>
           <p>This is a scenario where networks are unable to function as regular. Availability can be affected when an attacker performs a DDoS attack where a wifi access point is bombarded with data which usually results in a network becoming unavailable. Another is that the physical components of a network may become damaged such as the cables which affects the entire network.</p>
           <h4>THREATS</h4>
           <p>Below are possible threats which can have a detrimental impact on networks:</p>
           <ul>
               <li>Unauthorized access – This is  a key issue for networks as they usually contain sensitive data which can be accessed by unauthorized individuals by the use of tools such as rootkits and keyloggers where an attacker can obtain data such as passwords. Other malicious content may also become installed which can impact all aspects of a network once an attacker has gained access to the network.</li>
               <li>Lack of physical control- This can hugely affect networks as components can be stolen which can affect many aspects of networks such as its availability and integrity as the user will no longer be able to use the network as well as data being stolen. Another example can be components becoming damaged.</li>
               <li>Theft – Sensitive data can be stolen within networks which ultimately allow attackers to distribute the data. Identity theft also occurs within networks where attackers eavesdrop to obtain the hardwares MAC address. (SecurityTrails, 2018) </li>
           </ul>
           <h4>THREAT MITIGATION</h4>
           <p>Below are  listed common mitigation methods and tools to help prevent threats from entering a network. (Anon, 2016)
</p>
           <ul>
               <li>Honeypots - Decoy systems designed to tempt a potential attacker away from critical systems, collect information about his/her activity and also encourage the attacker to stay long enough for the administrator to respond.</li>
               <li>Firewall -This is an additional layer of defense which offers a barrier for internal networks from external networks. All traffic should pass through the firewall and should only pass if authorised by the firewall. The firewall should also be immune from penetration testing.
</li>
               <li>VPN- Encrypted network connections that prevent direct connections to and from the local network occuring. </li>
               <li>Username enumeration and strong passwords – Companies should have a policy in place which allows only the use of complex passwords so that they are not easily obtained.</li>
               <li>User awareness training  – Users and employees should have a great understanding of policies and how to behave in a way that the network can stay protected with the help of training programs. (Rossi, 2015)</li>
                  </ul>
           <h4>RISK MITIGATION</h4>
           <p>For a business it is also important to have a set policies and procedures that can mitigate the
risks of business privacy in network systems. These policies should cover issues such as data backups, malware protection, keeping devices secure, safeguarding passwords and avoiding social attacks. Risks could also be evaluated with the aid of risk control where every risk has a response already set out alongside the probability of this threat occurring so that a business can prioritise properly. (Herrera, 2013)</p>
                     <h4>SOCIAL ISSUES</h4>
           <p>Privacy breaches in business network systems may lead to social issues for individuals. One common form of attack are SQL injections that aim to steal, delete or manipulate data in databases. This can result in a disclosure of sensitive data of customers, employees or employers stored within the database. The adversary might also use that information to extort the victim and ask for a ransom or other types of payments. In order to mitigate these  risks, businesses are required to follow protocols and standards such as the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA) where the implementation of the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) have been enacted by the European Union to protect individual's data.</p>
<p>The way users  use their accounts can also affect a network. Idle accounts have been a big target for hackers as they are able to post fraudulent messages without any form of restriction. This makes it important that accounts are fully regulated and safeguards are in place to ensure nothing like this ever happens to customers in a professional setting (Ghose and Rajan, 2006)
.</p>
          
           <h4>LEGAL ISSUES</h4>
           <p>Legal requirements in relation to network security in the UK are mostly based on the Data Protection Act 1998, which requires organisations to take “appropriate technical and organisational measures” to protect personal data from unauthorised access, damage, loss or disclosure. Such measures must ensure a level of protection that is appropriate, taking into account the harm that may be caused to individuals in the event of a data security breach and the nature of the data. When deciding which security measures to put in place, the Act further specifies that organisations should consider the state of technological development and the costs of implementing the measures.</p>
<p>If the privacy of individuals is violated the business could face legal issues over principles which must be considered when securing a network system. There are a variety of sanctions that can be imposed if the company doesn’t comply with EU law on data protection (European Commission, n.d.). Violators can face a fine of €20 million or up to 4% of the annual worldwide turnover of the preceding financial year (European Commission, 2016).</p>
 
           <h4>ETHICAL ISSUES</h4>
           <p>Fair treatment of customers is at the heart of UK business models according to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). This involves protecting their personal information. Customers trust the company will not allow the disclosure of their data; therefore, not designing an efficient network security system that accomplishes this is not ethically acceptable. Employees' privacy should be protected too. An employer will probably have information about the employee such as his/her ethnic origin, sexuality. beliefs, health condition, salary and all this must be kept confidential. (FCA, 2015) </p>
<p>The following personal data is considered 'sensitive' and subject to specific processing conditions according to the GDPR (European Commission, n.d.):</p>
<ul>
<li>personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical
beliefs</li>
<li>trade-union membership;</li>
<li>genetic data, biometric data processed solely to identify a human being;</li>
<li>health-related data;</li>
<li>data concerning a person’s sex life or sexual orientation.</li>
</ul>
           <h4>ISSUES AND APPROPRIATE SECURITY MECHANISMS THAT PROTECT NETWORKS</h4>
           <p>The issues that arise within networks as mentioned is the threat of unauthorized access and the theft of data which can occur as a byproduct. For issues that affect networks with detrimental intent can be possible attacks. These are some of the issues that may occur and are possible to affect the business.</p>
           <p>Network systems can often be under the threat of social attacks such as phishing where employees can be fooled into taking the wrong advice and ultimately disclosing sensitive data. Attackers most of the time will be able to access the network with the information they have received and carry out attacks or obtain more data. In order for this issue to be resolved, people should undergo training programs on the security of networks to ensure that they do not fall for these traps and that the network remains safe.</p>
           <p>The theft of data in general is a massive problem for networks. Sensitive information could become disclosed once any attacker gains access. The key to fixing this problem would be implementing a honeypot which distracts the attacker by acting as a decoy and swaying them away from the real sensitive data. This allows enough time for an administrator to handle the situation</p>
           <p>Possible active attacks are an issue that can happen outside of a network and can be detrimental to its availability. Possible attacks can be a DoS (denial of service), which consists of an access point being bombarded with information, affecting the business overall function. Some approaches to prevent any detrimental damage to the system are implementing intrusion detection and prevention systems. These would help detect and protect the flow of traffic from any detrimental files from entering the system. Furthermore, a VPN could be used to prevent direct connections to the network from occurring. </p>
<p>Attackers are also able to  intercept data by an attack known as ‘man in the middle’ which consists in the attacker impersonating a trusted entity  and intercepting the transmission of data which they are not authorized for.  Another attack can be the use of spyware such as keyloggers and screen monitors which are passive viruses that are designed to monitor the live actions of the system. This can be prevented with the implementation of anti spyware which will not allow these passive viruses to enter the system. </p>
